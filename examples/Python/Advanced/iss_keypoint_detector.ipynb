    "In this tutorial we will show how to detect the **ISS** Keypoints of a 3D shape. The implementation is based on the keypoint detection modules proposed in Yu Zhong , \"Intrinsic Shape Signatures: A Shape Descriptor for 3D Object Recognition\", 2009.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{array}{l}\n",
    "\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}(\\mathbf{p})=\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{\\mathbf{q} \\in \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{p})}\\left(\\mathbf{q}-\\mu_{\\mathbf{p}}\\right)\\left(\\mathbf{q}-\\mu_{\\mathbf{p}}\\right)^{T} \\quad \\text { with } \\\\\n",

    "The rationale is to avoid detecting keypoints at points exhibiting a similar spread along the principal directions, where a repeatable canonical reference frame cannot be established and, therefore, the subsequent description stage can hardly turn out effective.
